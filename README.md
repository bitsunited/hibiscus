Hibiscus
========

A Java based, plattform independent (running on Linux, Windows, OS X, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris) homebanking application, that uses the 
german FinTS/HBCI standard. All data (accounts, transactions, addresses, ..) are stored encrypted into an embedded database (H2) by default or on a Mysql server (if configured).

Hibiscus runs as a plugin within the [Jameica framework](https://github.com/willuhn/jameica) as either a typical desktop application or headless in server mode.
